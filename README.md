# Amazing-Numbers
Project made for Jetbrains Academy 30-day Challenge (jun-2021) created in Java.

This program calculates numbers based on the user input.

In this project, there are some pretty 'strange' numbers, some of them are:

- **Buzz Numbers**:
They are numbers that are either divisible by 7 or end with 7. 

- **Duck Numbers**:
A Duck number is a positive number that contains zeroes. Note that a number with a leading 0 is not a Duck number.

- **Gapful Numbers**:
Gapful number is a number that contains at least 3 digits and is divisible by the concatenation of its first and last digit without a remainder.

- **Spy Numbers**:
A number is said to be Spy if the sum of all digits is equal to the product of all digits.

- **Sunny** and **Square numbers**:
N is a sunny number if N+1 is a perfect square number. In mathematics, a square number or a perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of an integer with itself.

- **Jumping Numbers**:
A number is a Jumping number if the adjacent digits inside the number differ by 1. The difference between 9 and 0 is not considered as 1. Single-digit numbers are considered Jumping numbers.

- **Happy** and **Sad numbers**:
A happy number is a number that reaches 1 after a sequence during which the number is replaced by the sum of each digit squares. A number that is not happy is called... (guess what) Sad.
