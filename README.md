# Amazing-Numbers
Project made for Jetbrains Academy 30-day Challenge (jun-2021) created in Java.

This program calculates numbers based on the user input.

In this project, there are some pretty 'strange' numbers, some of them are:

- **Buzz Numbers**:
They are numbers that are either divisible by 7 or end with 7. For example, the number 14 is a buzz number, since it is divisible by 7 without a remainder; the number 17 ends with 7, so it is also a buzz number.

- **Duck Numbers**:
A Duck number is a positive number that contains zeroes. For example, 3210, 8050896, 70709 are Duck numbers. Note that a number with a leading 0 is not a Duck number. So, numbers like 035 or 0212 are not Duck numbers. Although, 01203 is a Duck, since it has a trailing 0.

- **Gapful Numbers**:
Gapful number is a number that contains at least 3 digits and is divisible by the concatenation of its first and last digit without a remainder. 12 is not a Gapful number, as it has only two digits. 132 is a Gapful number, as 132 % 12 == 0.

- **Spy Numbers**:
A number is said to be Spy if the sum of all digits is equal to the product of all digits.

- **Sunny** and **Square numbers**:
N is a sunny number if N+1 is a perfect square number. In mathematics, a square number or a perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of an integer with itself.

- **Jumping Numbers**:
A number is a Jumping number if the adjacent digits inside the number differ by 1. The difference between 9 and 0 is not considered as 1. Single-digit numbers are considered Jumping numbers. For example, 78987, and 4343456 are Jumping numbers, but 796 and 89098 are not.

- **Happy** and **Sad numbers**:
A happy number is a number that reaches 1 after a sequence during which the number is replaced by the sum of each digit squares. For example, 13 is a happy number, as 12 + 32 = 10 which leads to 12 + 02 = 1. A number that is not happy is called... (guess what) Sad.
