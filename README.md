# Amazing-Numbers
Project made for Jetbrains Academy 30-day Challenge (jun-2021) created in Java.
In this project, there are some pretty 'strange' numbers, some of them are:

- Buzz Numbers:
They are numbers that are either divisible by 7 or end with 7. For example, the number 14 is a buzz number, since it is divisible by 7 without a remainder; the number 17 ends with 7, so it is also a buzz number.

- Duck Numbers:
A Duck number is a positive number that contains zeroes. For example, 3210, 8050896, 70709 are Duck numbers. Note that a number with a leading 0 is not a Duck number. So, numbers like 035 or 0212 are not Duck numbers. Although, 01203 is a Duck, since it has a trailing 0.

- Gapful Numbers:
Gapful number is a number that contains at least 3 digits and is divisible by the concatenation of its first and last digit without a remainder. 12 is not a Gapful number, as it has only two digits. 132 is a Gapful number, as 132 % 12 == 0.

- Spy Numbers:
A number is said to be Spy if the sum of all digits is equal to the product of all digits.

- Sunny and square numbers:
N is a sunny number if N+1 is a perfect square number. In mathematics, a square number or a perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of an integer with itself.
